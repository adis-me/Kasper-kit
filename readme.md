# Kirby kit

## Credits
This Kirby kit was created just to showcase that Kirby is a easy starting point for a custom blog or custom CMS. The real credits are for: [Kirby](http://www.getkirby.com), [Sasha Lack's Base blog](http://sashtown.de/blog/what-baseblog-is) and the [Casper theme from Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper).

## Installation

The easiest way to install the Kasper kit:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/adis-me/kasper-kit.git
```
Then the inside the kasper-kit folder just run the PHP built in webserver:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

That's it, enjoy!
